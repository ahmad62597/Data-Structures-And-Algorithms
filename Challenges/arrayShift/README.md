#Insert and Shift Middle of Index Array
This program causes an extra integer to be populated into a preset array of 5 integers

##Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.


##Approach
I took a two different approaches, one attempt I tried with my partner and the other attempt that I finished was through the code was
planning my steps out seperatly, and trying to solve it in the most simple and efficient way. I created an original array and attempted 
to give different solutions for each possible case.
